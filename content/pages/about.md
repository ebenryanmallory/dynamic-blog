  My name is Eben Mallory, and the motivation for Dynamic Momentum comes from
  the fact that I was in a snowboarding accident while in high school, and I
  have experienced a lot of frustration from a lack of understanding and lack of
  solutions for the neurological disorder I have as a result. I also went on to
  experience firsthand some of the most cutting edge solutions while working in
  a startup incubator type of environment at UC Berkeley working on wearable
  robotic exoskeletons.

  The name Dynamic Momentum comes from some of the research projects we worked
  on - while looking for ways to create improvements on the current exoskeleton
  design (at the time, this was a flagship model of Ekso Bionics), our team
  discovered a number of ways to replace motors used in that design with passive
  mechanisms, or just using gravity in a way that it would accomplish the same
  force trajectory and movement that was being accomplished by an active,
  motorized system. 




  The purpose of this website is not to become a company or a nonprofit, but
  rather to provide an information base for further research. I am one person
  and will continue to research with a goal of improving current ideas and
  systems, and also foster an environment where others can contribute to this
  goal. Instead of traditional business models which have caused me frustrations
  in the past, I am using new ideas that change the landscape and create an
  environment more closely aligned with my goals of creating usable information
  and solutions that have a real impact on users, as opposed to having those
  goals be at odds with making a sustainable business model. [Learn about an
