  Approaching hardware development especially in the area of IOT is gaining
  popularity and many concepts from software development can be used for
  hardware development, and even more so when software is also part of the
  product.

Many companies are already making robotic exoskeletons for medical purposes. New ideas for uses such as skiing are being explored and used recreationally. Exoskeletons for workers are just beginning to take off, and quickly morphing into various types and styles to solve different problems encountered in workplace situations. As medical exoskeletons exploded as a massively publicized idea, when the reality of challenges facing this design started to become apparent and monetary opportunity from a much larger general population (industrial workers), improvement on general design began to shift toward a more general population. This is actually a good thing for medical application devices, because the larger industry will push technology to advance rapidly, and adapting the technology to a medical application will become much easier than inventing it.

## Why support open source?

Any company not developing a competitive solution in this area internally can benefit from having a platform to build on. From my own personal best guess, any company wanting to do this is at least about 10 years behind in R&D compared to these larger companies.

## Ulterior motivations:

My primary goal is to reach those who can benefit from products like commercially available exoskeletons. Providing free or low cost solutions and having a platform to improve how these solutions work can reach more people needing them and have a greater overall impact.
