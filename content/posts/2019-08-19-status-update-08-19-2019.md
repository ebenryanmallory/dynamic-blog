This is a quick update post on the status of rapid testing and how the progress is going.

I have taken a picture of what I think I will call the franken-haxo model of testing prototype. Thoughts at first were very negative as there is basically no way to "don" the haxo. So basically I tried multiple ways of just putting it on, attaching it to myself in any way I could. This feature was not included in any way for this prototype, on purpose. After multiple attempts, height adjustments, and misfires I finally stabilized myself enough to get a couple of velcro straps together and it held.

After manually adjusting the angle of how far back the Haxo legs trail behind my feet (this will need to be locked in both directions, but for now it just dangles until it hits the ground), I got situated and tested the balance. My reaction was simple: "wow". Sure I was testing a theory and hopefully expected to get a certain result, but actually experiencing it was very different. I have never before seen anything else like it - and that is basically the point of this blog, website, and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dynamicmomentum) partnership I have with you guys.

I know there is a lot of proving theories and scientific validation that will need to occur in the future, and it will in due time. As the prolific sage Foy Vance once said:
