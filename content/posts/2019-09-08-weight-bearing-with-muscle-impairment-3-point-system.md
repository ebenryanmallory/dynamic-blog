excerpt: Weight bearing with muscle impairment - 3 point system
---
Any patient with a medical condition which affect muscle strength either in a severe manner or makes it impossible for the patient to have any muscle control or stability at all can still use a standing device or similar mechanism to bear weight through their lower body using a 3 point system. Exceptions to this are if the patient has severe spasticity or lacks flexibility of full range of motion for any reason.

___

3 point system - stabilization at the knee is the first and most important point because the most force from gravity will go through this point. This will tend to push the knee out and forward. Stabilization means that the knee cannot go forward and has something to press up against. In all actuality it is the only point that is absolutely required, although in most cases this point will be also stabilized against the other two points - above halfway between knee and hip, and below halfway between knee and heel.
