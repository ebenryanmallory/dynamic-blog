# Braces for legs

![plastic braces](/images/uploads/plastic-braces.jpg)

Plastic leg bracing has been around for a long time and still exists today as the main way of providing support for muscle impairment for people with very little or no muscle strength. This is an area technology can come into and has a lot of room for improvement. These types of medical devices solve the basic problem of providing support for a patient, but lack many features and also can cause a number of problems for patients, sometimes so much that using them becomes undesirable. For patients that can use them, they have to actively manage these problems on a near constant basis.

## Wearable robotic exoskeletons

Newer technology has come along that replaces this type of bracing with a premise of offloading the tasks of movement to a robotic system with actuators for people with muscle impairment. While this is a great idea in theory and publicity frenzy has generated massive buzz around exoskeleton technology being nearly a "cure" or at least the best solution that exists in today's landscape, the reality is that the current state of the technology places them in a non viable solution category. I like to make the analogy of an amusement park ride - it's great to get on, feel the excitement and experience, and take some pictures to show everyone. But then you have to get off and go about your day.

This is not due to some type of financial restriction, lack of distribution or prevalence in the technology, or some type of logistics issue. The technology is simply not usable in a real life situation - the only way to use most models is with a trained person standing ready to catch a patient falling. Even models that can be used without supervision become a huge safety concern due to the risk of falling. In addition to the patient possibly getting hurt, the process of getting back up is non trivial. 

This has very real implications for an end user - primarily that the amount of energy in preventing the device from becoming out of safe balance range can make using it more energy intensive than using archaic plastic bracing systems.

## The next steps:

Even a simple open source project that prioritizes features correctly can be more effective and more usable than plastic braces or exoskeleton technology. It can be implemented in a real world scenario, such as everyday use. The primary goal of this open source information is to document how to buy or make these devices, how they work, and how to implement them.
