# Overview

Standard crutch tips can be interfaced either with the foot plate above the ankle and be activate by gravity, or interfaced to the additional exo balance points that rest behind the legs. This is just in idea phase and has not been implemented or tested, and is theoretical as to whether it could work. The idea for the passive mechanism is that gravity will actually place them into the ground as the patient leans in any direction, and stop the leaning process before it gets to a point of becoming a significant amount of force to compensate to regain balance.
