# A better approach

While current exoskeletons focus on offsetting physical momentum loads onto motors, prioritizing goals requires these devices to focus on balance. This isn't a scientific conclusion and lacks evidence and research to back up my opinion on this topic, but as an end user I have worked off of this assumption to create something that I had a purely self serving desire of putting to actual use.

## A quick overview

By using off the shelf braces designed to work for people experiencing post surgery recovery, we build a platform that can be used to build some groundwork of conformity. In other words if many people use the same brace infrastructure, and an addon is invented to improve the system, it always interfaces or connects in the same way and the inventor does not need to create and interface for many bracing systems, which makes their job much easier.

The leg bracing system is heavily modified and uses off the shelf skateboard bindings to provide foot plates and locked support at the ankles in much the same style many exoskeletons use. A solid connection is required that supports full body weight.

## Next up:

From this building block, we can then implement a prototype, work in progress balancing system. It can be implemented as a DIY project and most of the parts can be bought online. The purpose of this open source documentation is how to implement this addon. As a prototype version of this process, the information on how to do this will change and become updated (with possible breaking changes, i.e. using completely different hardware) in the future, much like a software library or framework.
