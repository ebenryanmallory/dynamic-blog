You hear the cliches a lot, and there is so much "click bait" out there. I read about new things all the time and feel like I have a jaded, cynical screen I have to process everything through. My personal challenge was how can I do something different?

___

First off, I have positioned myself to align with the actual goals of the website - in other words, the goal is to make something usable that has never been done before, and not to make money. If I fluff up facts, it just hurts me as an end user.

There are massive companies doing R+D in this area, including DARPA funded projects funding the most effective researchers we know of. How can one small website and one person behind it contribute? Well - with a lot of help from people reading this blog post. But even before I started this website, I realized I could make something nobody had used or seen ever before, even if someone else out there has something similar that I just don't know about. The issue really comes down to this: with all the vast landscape that is out there, what is actually going to do anything for me personally? I would love it if someone else went ahead and made a product for me - I could just buy it! I used to think like this, but no product came along. Instead of waiting around, I decided to do something about.

I have worked side by side with the smartest and most talented people in this area and I have had the hard questions asked of me - how can I create something more effective than a team of researchers with degrees and accreditations from the most prestigious institutes working full time with funding and resources and guidance? It's a good question, and my response was always that really I couldn't do anything they could not do better. But after watching the focus and direction of these people play out, pretentions fall away, and real results become documented I was left with the same question once again - what is actually going to do anything for me personally? It's not so much that they ultimately failed to achieve what they set out to accomplish at all, it's just that creating something for me to use was not their goal.

## What this website aspires to do, and does not aspire to do.

Basically the goal of the information in this website is to provide the groundwork to build a product, but not to actually build it. I intend to create a "DIY" style project that anyone can build, replicate, and use - but not actually sell it as a standalone solution. There are a couple of main reasons for this: 

1. Safety liability - when selling a product, liability issues can create complications for a company. 

2. Without resources an actual polished product cannot be manufactured. 3D printing and technological advances in making this type of product have come a long way and it would be possible, but with the current state of resources it is not, as of yet.

Before an actual product can be made, a proof of concept MVP needs to be tested to see if it can even work, preferably informed by users or potential users, and a few cycles or iterations of improving the device can lead to an idea of what it is you want to actually produce. Ideally the ideas developed here would be produced and interested third parties would take them and produce a product, especially if they are better suited and have the resources and expertise to do so. While most companies out there in this area probably keep these types of ideas to themselves protected by intellectual property rights or patents, my personal interest is in developing ideas in a collaborative, transparent way instead of protecting potential profits.
