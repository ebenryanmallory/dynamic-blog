Currently the prototype version of adding balance to an independent brace system (i.e. the patient can already stand and bear weight through the system) uses an off the shelf product which can be purchased online called a standing chair.

Two of these together can provide the basic infrastructure to copy a concept used by a technology innovation leading company:

This can be interfaced to existing brace systems in a way that provides two additional balance points to a normal human balancing pattern. In addition, using the basic idea in repeat process can provide more balance points, if necessary, until enough are present to be stable (which will vary by individual).

## Why balance?

Even newer companies entering into the market that I have observed have a focus on safety. Without creating a product that can be used safely, it seems they do not feel they can create a product that can be brought to market. They take the approach that obtaining balance can be accomplished the same way a refrigerator is balanced.  Some examples I have seen even include a tether to the ceiling for patient safety. While safe, this is not practical for everyday use.

## The basic idea:

The premise is there becomes a gray line between what is standing and what is sitting. Patients have balanced themselves sitting in wheelchairs, and nobody has safety concerns (although many other side effect problems are experienced). If a progressive way of going from sitting in a balanced manner can be pushed to an edge but still provide safe patient stability (which varies for individuals), then it may be possible to incorporate a walking motion style of movement while retaining the stability of being seated.
