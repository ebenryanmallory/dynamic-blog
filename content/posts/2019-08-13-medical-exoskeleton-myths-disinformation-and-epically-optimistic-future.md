I felt I needed to clarify the current state of exoskeleton technology in the medical realm. Although advances have been made and will continue at an exponential growth rate, understanding the current state is important to identify a reason for new technology and products to exist. Many products currently on the market are marketed as a solution for a medical condition where people have used wheelchairs in the past and are presented as an alternative or replacement. Uninformed viewers of this type of messaging piece together a lot of blanks to questions such as: "Why aren't more people adopting this technology?". Perhaps they cannot afford it, or have a lack of access to the technology in some way. 
In actuality, any product that is currently on the market is not really practical for everyday lifestyle use. It's not so much that it is not possible, it just isn't desirable. For example, if a user expends x amount of energy from using their arms to balance and mobilize themselves using leg braces, and 2x energy using the latest and most amazing technology, the user will conclude it is more optimal to simply use brace technology. This is just an example, but it is not far from the reality of the situation - with a couple of oversimplifications.
More specifically what happens with large wearable robotic devices including motors, extensive infrastructure, batteries, etc. the weight of the device becomes significant. The theoretical science of how these devices work is that the weight goes through the exoskeleton infrastructure and into the ground, so the user never lifts the full weight of it. While this does work as imagined, if the user begins to fall over and correct their balance using a crutch interface to the ground, the energy required to this increases as overall weight increases. Also if they are further into the process of falling, this becomes physically difficult. In emergency situations, the user basically needs to lift their entire body weight plus any added weight at least an inch or two (and possibly more) off the ground to reposition their balance and stability back to being centered. There is no scientific reference I can site here, I have just simply experienced this firsthand for many years so you will just have to take my word for it. 
The misconception of how a medical exoskeleton "should" work may take form in some type of storyline similar to:

1. A potential patient / user of a medical exoskeleton lacks strength or muscle to put their legs through a walking trajectory motion.
2. We can attach motorized parts, and program the motion to mimic a walking pattern on their behalf.
Although this seems like a good model for an idea, it would be more accurate to think of a person with a mobility disorder as having a lack of balance. The leg trajectory of bio-mimicry in many animals (such as a fish, or human) actually requires very little strength and can be accomplished in a control lacking sense without a person having any muscle strength. 
In extensive testing with various styles of motor assisted movement, I have personally found that it is about the same difficulty and energy requirements when motors offset and propel a leg trajectory motion on my behalf, without any energy from me to do so. The reason for this is I have to use the same amount of strength to correct my balance as if I were using crutches for movement. The balance correction is reversed (think going uphill vs downhill): in other words instead of compensating moving myself forward, I am balance compensating being moved forward. However, with the added weight, balance compensation actually becomes harder.
Again this is really only one point of view based on my personal opinion, but a number of products and companies have resources tied up in these types of products and they are going to have to solve for this problem if they are not already aware of it. 
To make matters worse, going back to the "far into a fall trajectory" scenario mentioned earlier where a user now has to lift themselves up in an emergency, with significant added weight this becomes a safety concern if the user cannot correct their balance using crutches. Also in the event of a fall, added weight crashing down on a user is not very desirable. 
To take a critical look at products in the current market some critical information is omitted such as:
1. What happens when a user falls? Some companies address this by tethering a patient, spotting them significantly by another person at all times, or only allowing the product to be used in a controlled environment. 
2. How much energy is used by the patient? Is it practical to use as an assistive device as opposed to a publicly showcased novelty.
Well the whole point of all this technology is that it holds a promise of massive development and improving far past even our imagination, and a real world trajectory of breaking through human limitations in a somewhat relatively near future. Looking back in time as to how far technology has come and comparing it to other technology such as cell phones, we can only reasonably believe that the potential growth in this area could be enormous. This is the time. 
That being said, however, we need to ask the hard questions and be open about the obstacles in the current landscape. In my opinion this can be a collaborative effort in the same way software is built openly and collaboratively. The challenges are great, but the potential is greater.
