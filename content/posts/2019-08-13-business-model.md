# Business Model

By providing and information base open to anyone to use, I plan to bring the most benefit to end users possible at no cost to them.

In addition, by providing educational resources and access to DIY projects, users can purchase necessary parts to build their own products.

As a final step, optional (or sometimes necessary) parts can sometimes be an opportunity for me to work on creating, and then charge for those more difficult pieces of projects to make them come together and remain simple and manageable.

## The challenge:

When creating a startup, it is important to get funding and sometimes businesses can focus on getting funding instead of making a product that actually works. The premise here is that the funding will allow the research necessary to create the end product. While this type of fundraising helps the business side, it hurts the end user of the product. This problem becomes even more apparent in certain industries such as medical treatments in a hospital system where patients may not even need to ultimately benefit from the treatment, but a company can still sell the product or treatment through to health care providers.

## The solution:

I am adopting an approach long embraced by the software industry: open source. Open source hardware is beginning to become more commonplace. Open source is funded by contributors (many times enterprise companies interested in using the open source project). Many times startups will adopt a typical business model built on top of an open source project (especially when it is new technology) and provide a higher level of features, support, user experience, etc. on top of the open source technology, but open source creation itself is a viable business model as well. 

This approach negates any conflict of interest coming from desiring to make money to sustain product development and has the highest positive impact at the lowest cost for end users.
