When attempting to use a standing device, or a bracing system, or a wearable device based on these concepts many factors can come up to impede balance and stability which make it difficult to use or adjust to at first. From my own personal experience I can say that the expected result (not the exception) is that the patient will have so many different factors working against them that the first attempt will almost always fail. Again, this is expected and it just takes time to work through the problems and optimize as much as possible and keep attempting to get more stabilization and balance.

1. First it is important to realize that stabilzation and balance is a spectrum - it is not going to be a black and white pass or fail. Optimizations and practice and problem solving can improve stability and balance.

___

2. I have personally experienced the phenomenon that the body tends to conform to a shape it is commonly placed into - for someone in a wheelchair full time this means that the hips tend to stay bent slightly and the knees tend to stay bent slightly. A patient with full range of motion can still stand up straight without encountering much resistance, but there is an amount of resistance pulling the position of joints from a standing position to a slightly bent position, more conformed to a sitting position. This "resistance" effect makes stabilization and balance techniques nearly impossible even with very little resistance because of how they are designed. It directly contradicts the physics of the mechanisms in play that create the stabilization. 

___ 

This can be very frustrating for people and cause psychological reasons for thinking they cannot or are not qualified to use this type of device. However (again from personal experience) it is possible to work through this in many cases - by simply placing the joints in a straightened out position for extended periods of time without stressing or overextending anything will reduce the resistance from the initial state. 

___

3. Brace system calibration - many factors can contribute to causing the same problem and it can be impossible to tell which factor is causing the miscalibration. For example if one leg is not bearing weight properly, this could be caused (and fixed) by the adjustment of the knee or the ankle. Everyone is different and will require different settings and this has to be worked through and can take a few tries.
