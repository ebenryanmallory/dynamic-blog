Building on top of the concepts of dynamic stability as a focus, using a standardized and off the shelf (mostly) brace system, and very proof of concept designs, I will outline the state of the project at this point.

So far using the ergonomic chair (Safeco Mogo - http://www.safcoproducts.com/products/seating/focal%E2%84%A2-mogo-seat) I have demonstrated stabilization in one direction in a very high gray area between being "seated" and "standing". This is not surprising and has obviously been demonstrated on healthy individuals. Connecting two of them together and positioning the second either to the right or left side of the main one had the intended effect of providing stability against falling in that direction. Of course there is a radius outside of which a user will still fall, but the goal is to stabilize a person inside of that radius without the user having to do it themselves. 

Preliminary testing indicates that basic balancing in the sense that a user will not easily move outside the radius at a resting point is achieved from resistance in falling toward the back, right, or left sides. This implies that falling to the front, front-right side, or front-left side is still possible in the same way and no stability is provided in these areas. However, to compensate for this without building more infrastructure the user may be able to keep their balance in a state of pressing into the stability points to the back: in other words they can stay in a constant state of leaning over backwards to prevent themselves from getting to a place where they might tip forwards. 

Although the seat is lightweight, the current form has one seat and three legs. Most likely the middle one is unnecessary and can be removed if the seat is connected adequately. 

In summary - partial dynamic stability has been accomplished which does not require a user to compensate for slight balance disturbances with an interface to the ground (normally this would be using crutches). This has been tested only in a standing (seated, but upright), non moving position. Although these results are not particularly surprising, the implications are far reaching.
